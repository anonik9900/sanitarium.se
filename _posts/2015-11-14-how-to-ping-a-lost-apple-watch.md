# Background

I just misplaced my Apple Watch in the apartment, looking in the usual places
lead nowhere. Walking around frustrated I was thinking, "There ought to be a way
to make it make some sound. Like a sonar!". I searched the internet but my
Google-fu failed me, no obvious way to "ping my watch", like the functionality
for [pinging the phone], when I misplace it.

But there's a way to make some noise; testing out the alert volume in the
companion app on the phone.

## Steps

1. Verify that your Watch is paired:
   1. Settings
   2. Bluetooth
   3. My Devices should show your Watch:
      <img src="{{ '/img/2015/11/bluetooth-settings.png' | prepend: site.url }}"
           alt="Bluetooth settings on an iPhone" style="max-width: 375px;">
2. Open the Apple Watch app:
   1. Sounds & Haptics
   2. Drag the slider for alert volume to max
   3. Tap the knob on the slider.  
      The watch will make a sound every time you tap the knob.
      <img src="{{ '/img/2015/11/alert-volume-settings.png' | prepend: site.url }}"
           alt="Alert volume settings" style="max-width: 375px;">
3. Don't cry yourself to sleep over loosing an expensive toy in the mess that is
   your own apartment.
